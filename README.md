# Scene_text_detection_and_recognition

## Stage One detection
We use yolov5 to capture the text of the scene.

YoloV5 will extract two types of objects from the scene, the first type is Chinese characters and the second type is English\Digit strings and characters.

How to generate these data for GT?

The first type of Chinese characters are generated by the T-brain Chinese characters and the ReCTS Chinese characters.

The second type of English string and character is generated by T-Brain's English\Digit string and ReCTS's English \Digit character.
