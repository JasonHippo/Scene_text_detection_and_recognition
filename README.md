# Scene_text_detection_and_recognition

## Stage One detection
We use yolov5 to capture the text of the scene.

YoloV5 will extract two types of objects from the scene, the first type is Chinese character and the second type is English\Numeric string or character.

How to generate GT for YOLO training ?

The first type is generated by the T-Brain's Chinese characters and the ReCTS's Chinese characters.

The second type is generated by T-Brain's English\Numeric strings and the ReCTS's English\Numeric characters.
